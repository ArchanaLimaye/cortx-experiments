The cortex-experiments repo is used for recording all the pocs and experiments executed by architecture team.

Guideline for adding a new poc -
1. Add a new directory in repo.
2. Inside the new directory, create three directories objective, docs and src.
3. The objective directory contains a document explaining the objective of poc.
4. The docs document contains all the documents generated for as a result of poc.
5. The src directory should contain any code which was written for executing the poc.
